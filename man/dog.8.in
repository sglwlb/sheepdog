.SH NAME
dog \- Command line utility for the sheep daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "dog <command> <subcommand> [options]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dog
- Sheepdog is a distributed storage system for QEMU. It provides
highly available block level storage volumes to virtual machines.
Sheepdog supports advanced volume management features such as snapshot,
cloning, and thin provisioning. The architecture of Sheepdog is fully
symmetric; there is no central node such as a meta-data server.

The server daemon is called sheep(8).  A command line utility is available
via dog(8).  QEMU virtual machines use the sheep daemon via a block
driver available in qemu(1).

For more information, run 'dog <command> <subcommand> --help'.
