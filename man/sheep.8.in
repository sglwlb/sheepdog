.SH NAME
sheep \- Distributed Block Storage System for QEMU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "sheep [options] [PATH]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sheep
- Sheepdog is a distributed storage system for QEMU. It provides
highly available block level storage volumes to virtual machines.
Sheepdog supports advanced volume management features such as snapshot,
cloning, and thin provisioning. The architecture of Sheepdog is fully
symmetric; there is no central node such as a meta-data server.

The server daemon is called sheep(8).  A command line utility is available
via dog(8).  QEMU virtual machines use the sheep daemon via a block
driver available in qemu(1).

.SH PATH
Proper LSB systems will store sheepdog files in /var/lib/sheepdog.  The init
script uses this directory by default.  The directory must be on a filesystem
with xattr support.  In the case of ext3, user_xattr should be added to the
mount options.

mount \-o remount,user_xattr /var/lib/sheepdog
