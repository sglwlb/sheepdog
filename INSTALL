Sheepdog Installation Guide
===========================

Run-time dependencies
---------------------
* Three or more x86-64 machines.
* The corosync and corosync lib package or zookeeper equivalent
* QEMU 0.13 or later
* liburcu

Compile-time dependencies
-------------------------
* GNU Autotools
* corosync devel package
* liburcu devel package
* git
* optional:fuse-devel (for sheepfs)
* optional:libzookeeper-mt-dev (for zookeeper support)

Installing from source
------------------------------------
1. Compile or install the Corosync packages:
   Nearly every modern Linux distribution has x86_64 corosync binaries pre-built
   available via their repositories. We recommend you use these packages if they
   are available on your distribution.

   For debian package based systems:
   $ sudo aptitude install corosync libcorosync-dev

   For RPM package based systems:
   $ sudo yum install corosynclib-devel

   For EL6 (RHEL, CentOS, SL, etc), the provided version of corosync is too old
   and you must install corosync from source.

2. Download, build and install QEMU with Sheepdog support:

   QEMU 0.13 or later provides built-in support for sheepdog devices.  Some
   distributions provide pre-built versions of this newer version of QEMU.  If
   your distribution has an older version of QEMU or you prefer to compile from
   source, retrieve the latest QEMU and compile:

   $ git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git
   $ cd qemu
   $ ./configure
   $ sudo make install

3. Download, build and install the Sheepdog server and command line tools:

   $ git clone git://github.com/collie/sheepdog.git
   $ cd sheepdog
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ ./configure
   $ sudo make install

   If your want to built-in sheepfs and zookeeper support, try:
      $ ./configure --enable-zookeeper --enable-sheepfs

   Please note, sheepdog supports a "make rpm" target which will generate
   an rpm package that can be installed on the local machine.  To use this
   installation method, use the following instructions:

   At sheepdog source directory
   $ make rpm
   $ sudo rpm -ivh x86_64/sheepdog-0.*

Please read the README file, the sheep(8), dog(8) or sheepfs(8) man page for
further usage instructions.
